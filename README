ABOUT

LibKFFT is a free/open-source (ZLib licensed) C library providing fast fourier transform and other related operations for comlex and scalar double or float sequences.
DEVELOPMENT

LibKFFT is deeply redesigned fork KissFFT project by Mark Borgerding.
REALISED FEATURES

The features of LibKFFT include:

    complex and scalar fourier transformation operations (forward and inverse)
        64-bit float type (double) as default
        32-bit float type (float) if set option KFFT_HALF_SCALAR
    SIMD acceleration transform operations (now support SSE, SSE2, SSE3 (optional)) (build option)
    Recursive Rader algorithm for prime-number lenght sequenses (build option)
    Internal math functions (aka sqrt, sincos etc.) without system libm functions (build option)
    Parallelization with OpenMP framework (build option)
    2D, sparse, convolution(+2D) operations as build-time extensions
    Detail trace log in stdout for diagnostic (build option)
    Tiny API support for simplify code in trivial usage

BUILD AND TEST

Need sofware: meson >= 55.0, ninja >= 1.8.0
Test build on OS with CC:

    Linux (x86-64): GCC 9.3, Clang-10
    Windows (x86-64): MSVC 2015, 2017, Clang-10
    RPi3 (armhf): GCC 8.3

Build: configure build in meson_options.txt if need and run meson . ./<builddir> && ninja -C ./<builddir>
Test (donâ€™t implemented on Windows): if change option enable_tests use test ninja -C ./<builddir> <target>

    test_bot - run unit tests (need libcunit for build it)
    test_speed[_cpx,_scr] - run speed tests and compare with popular implementations
    test_speed_kfft[_cpx,_scr] - run speed tests for libkfft only (produce SVG and CSV)
    test_valide[_cpx,_scr] - run validate tests (use FFTW3 for compare)
